## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Implement unit tests for all core components
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Automate unit tests in CI pipeline

### Integration Testing
- Test ChirpStack API integration with mock server
- Test OPC UA server with standard OPC UA clients
- Verify bidirectional communication end-to-end

### Performance Testing
- Test with simulated load of 1000+ devices
- Verify handling of 100+ concurrent OPC UA connections
- Measure and optimize resource usage

### Security Testing
- Verify proper implementation of authentication mechanisms
- Test encryption for both ChirpStack and OPC UA communications
- Validate input handling and protection against attacks

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **ChirpStack API Changes**: Monitor ChirpStack releases and maintain compatibility
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Regular performance testing throughout development
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security reviews and following best practices
4. **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to requirements and change management process

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular project status reviews
- Early and continuous testing
- Modular architecture to isolate potential issues
- Comprehensive documentation to facilitate troubleshooting

## Resources

### Development Team
- 2 Backend Developers (Rust expertise)
- 1 OPC UA Specialist
- 1 QA Engineer
- 1 Project Manager

### Tools and Technologies
- Rust programming language
- OPC UA libraries (e.g., open62541 or equivalent Rust libraries)
- ChirpStack API
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub for version control
- CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)

## Post-Release Support Plan
- Bug fix releases as needed
- Regular security updates
- Quarterly feature updates based on user feedback
- Monitoring of ChirpStack API changes for compatibility updates
