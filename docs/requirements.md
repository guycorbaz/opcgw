   - Encryption modes (None, Sign, SignAndEncrypt)
   - Security policies (Basic128Rsa15, Basic256, Basic256Sha256)
6. The OPC UA server must support writing values to writable nodes that correspond to ChirpStack device parameters.
7. The OPC UA server must implement standard OPC UA services including Browse, Read, Write, and Subscribe.

### Bidirectional Communication
1. The application must support writing data back to ChirpStack devices from the OPC UA interface.
2. The application must allow sending commands to ChirpStack devices through OPC UA method calls.

### Configuration
1. The application must support configuration via TOML files.
2. The application must support environment variable overrides for configuration.
3. The configuration must include:
   - ChirpStack connection details (server address, API token, polling frequency)
   - OPC UA server settings (endpoint URL, security settings)
   - Application and device mapping definitions
   - Metric type definitions and mappings
   - Retry and timeout parameters
   - Data transformation rules
   - Access control policies

### Monitoring and Diagnostics
1. The application must expose operational metrics including:
   - Connection status to ChirpStack
   - Number of connected OPC UA clients
   - Request/response times
   - Error counts by category
2. The application must support different log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE).
3. The application must provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting connection issues.
4. The application must implement health check endpoints.
5. The application must support integration with monitoring systems via standard protocols.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. The application must handle at least 100 concurrent OPC UA client connections.
2. The application must efficiently process and store metrics from at least 1000 devices.
3. The application must minimize resource usage during idle periods.
4. The application must process updates within 100ms of receiving data from ChirpStack.
5. The application must maintain CPU usage below 50% on a standard server during normal operation.
6. The application must maintain memory usage proportional to the number of monitored devices.

### Scalability
1. The application must support horizontal scaling for handling larger deployments.
2. The application must maintain performance as the number of devices increases.
3. The application must support clustering for high availability.
4. The application must implement load balancing mechanisms for distributed deployments.

### Reliability
1. The application must recover from temporary ChirpStack server unavailability.
2. The application must maintain the last known good values when ChirpStack is unavailable.
3. The application must log errors and operational status for troubleshooting.
4. The application must achieve 99.9% uptime excluding planned maintenance.
5. The application must implement graceful degradation when resources are constrained.
6. The application must handle unexpected termination without data corruption.

### Security
1. The application must support secure communication with the ChirpStack API using TLS.
2. The OPC UA server must implement appropriate security measures (authentication, encryption).
3. The application must not expose sensitive information in logs or error messages.
4. The application must implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
5. The application must validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
